# What is Dagger [XDAG]

* The first mineable DAG based coin.
* XDAG is a novel application of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology that solves the issues currently facing blockchain technology.
* XDAG offer bleeding edge technology to offer a decentralised solution to the problems facing other cryptocurrencies. XDAG has no pre-mine or ICO, and is a true community-driven project aligned by a common goal and innovative development team.
* Dagger is part of a new wave of Distributed Ledger projects based on a DAG infrastructure. DAG, or Directed acyclic graph, is an alternative method for sending data amongst people within a distributed, decentralized environment. This is done without a blockchain, allowing for greater scalability.

## Principles
* Directed acyclic graph (DAG), not blockchain.
* Block = transaction = address.
* Mineable, no premine, no ICO.
* New money generates every 64 seconds.
* Simple original C realization, its not a clone of another software.
* Double sha256 hash, ECDSA cryptography (OpenSSL).
* CPU/GPU mining at present time, Bitcoin ASICs are not suitable.

## Roadmap
* RPC wallet
* Mobile wallets (iOS/Android)
* Halving time community vote
* Exchange listing
* Privacy features, including ring signatures
* Smart contracts
* DeFi
